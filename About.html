	<h1>ACM Code of Ethics</h1>
		<p>The Code of Ethics is not only designed for coding professionals to follow, but it aims to guide and bring purpose to all aspirants, hobbyists, students, educators and anyone who uses computing technology in their own meaningful way. 
			This serves as a guide that can be a basis on the instance these violations occur.
			The code can be their leading principles that can aid them to act responsibly and help them understand and apply the principle for a greater cause.
		<br>
		<p> </p>
		<br>
		The Code of Ethics serves it purposes through four core categories, expounded below:</p>
		<br>
		<h2>General Ethical Principles</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The General Ethical Principles focus on the identity of the individual as an entity with relevance to computing, as well as pertaining that one should be directed in contributing for the betterment of society, with the acknowledgement that all other individuals in the community are stakeholders of computing 
		 - which includes potential individuals who are interested in the course of action. These general principles heed the individual’s characteristics of integrity, reverence, objectivity, and courteousness not only towards fellow computing professionals but also the community. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Professional Responsibilities</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The Professional Responsibilities mainly focus on maintaining professionalism and quality in products and services, 
			which involve ensuring the security of resources utilized through authorized means or driven by public good.
			Principles under this category focus on the individual’s responsibility and liability of products or services done under professional work, and thus also drives the individual to ensure the products through thorough evaluation and review before public access to repel pending risks that may rise within the products and services.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Professional Leadership Principles</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary goal of the Professional Leadership Principles is to guarantee that the public interest guides all professional computing activities. They can:
	<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">
		<li>Explain, promote, and analyze how well group or organization members are fulfilling their social obligations.</li>
		<li>Manage staff and resources to improve the standard of living at work, and develop, implement, and support procedures and policies that adhere to the Code's guiding principles. </li>
		<li>Give group or organization members the chance to develop professionally. When changing or retiring systems, exercise caution.</li>
		<li>Recognize systems that are incorporated into society's infrastructure and take special care of them.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Code Compliance</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Code Compliance focuses on upholding, promoting, and respecting the code’s guiding principles is the focus of compliance with the code. 
Thus, the code considers the ACM’s membership to be void if the member commits any violations of the Code. Excellence in both technical and moral standards is essential for the future of computing. 
Therefore, the concepts of the Code should be followed and improved by computing professionals, and each ACM member should promote and encourage this behavior among the other computing professionals, regardless of affiliation with the organization.</p>
